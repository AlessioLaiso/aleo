# Aleo
Aleo is a slab serif typeface designed by Alessio Laiso. Aleo has semi-rounded details and a sleek structure, giving it a strong personality while keeping readability high. Originally launched in 2013, the update for the 10-year anniversary expands Aleo from 6 to 18 styles and adds variable font versions. The update also greatly improves language support, now including characters for Vietnamese and Pan-African Latin, and boasts many spacing and design improvements.
