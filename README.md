# Aleo
Aleo is a contemporary typeface designed by Alessio Laiso as the slab serif companion to the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/) font by Łukasz Dziedzic. Aleo has semi-rounded details and a sleek structure, giving it a strong personality while still keeping readability high. The family comprises six styles:  three weights (light, regular and bold) with corresponding true italics. [Learn more about Aleo](http://alessiolaiso.com/aleo-font).
