    Aleo is a slab serif typeface designed by Alessio Laiso. Aleo has semi-rounded details and a sleek structure, 
    giving it a strong personality while keeping readability high.

    Originally launched in 2013, the update for the 10-year anniversary expands Aleo from 6 to 18 styles and adds 
    variable font versions. The update also greatly improves language support, now including characters for Vietnamese 
    and Pan-African Latin, and boasts many spacing and design improvements.

    The Aleo font family is released under the SIL Open Font License, so it is free for both personal and commercial use.
